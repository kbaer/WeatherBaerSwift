# WeatherBaerSwift

I created this app as part of a job interview.  I was presented with following challenge, and knocked out this quick app in
response.

Pick the informative API (think news feed or weather alerts) of your choice and build an app that 

1. Displays the 10 most recent entries for that API
2. Allows a user to tap on an entry to receive more detailed information about that entry
3. Schedules an alert for 10 minutes after a user closes the app that reminds the user to check this feed
4. Bonus points for having the API be location-based
